Here are some goals related to scientific research and clinical medicine that I'd like to see accomplished in 2018.

*   Physicians come to know that precision/personalized medicine for the most part is based on a false premise
*   Machine learning/deep learning is understood to not find previously
    unknown information in data in the majority of cases, and tends to
    work better than traditional statistical models only when dominant
    non-additive effects are present and the signal:noise ratio is
    decently high
*   Practitioners will make more progress in correctly using "old"
    statistical tools such as regression models
*   Medical diagnosis is finally understood as a task in probabilistic
    thinking, and sensitivity and specificity (which are characteristics
    not only of tests but also of patients) are seldom used
*   Practitioners using cutpoints/thresholds for inherently continuous
    measurements will finally go back to primary references and find
    that the thresholds were never supported by data
*   Dichotomania is seen as a failure to understand utility/loss/cost
    functions and as a tragic loss of information
*   Clinical quality improvement initiatives will rely on randomized
    trial evidence and de-emphasize purely observational evidence;
    learning health systems will learn things that are actually true
*   Clinicians will give up on the idea that randomized clinical trials
    do not generalize to real-world settings
*   Fewer pre-post studies will be done
*   More research will be reproducible with sounder sample size
    calculations, all data manipulation and analysis fully scripted, and
    data available for others to analyze in different ways
*   Fewer sample size calculations will be based on a 'miracle' effect
    size
*   Non-inferiority studies will no longer use non-inferiority margins
    that are far beyond clinically significant
*   Fewer sample size calculations will be undertaken and more
    sequential experimentation done
*   More Bayesian studies will be designed and executed
*   Classification accuracy will be mistrusted as a measure of
    predictive accuracy
*   More researchers will realize that estimation rather than hypothesis
    testing is the goal
*   Change from baseline will seldom be *computed,* not to mention not
    used in an analysis
*   Percents will begin to be replaced with fractions and ratios
*   Fewer researchers will draw **any** conclusion from large p-values
    other than "the money was spent"
*   Fewer researchers will draw conclusions from small p-values

Some wishes expressed by others on Twitter:

*   No more ROC curves
*   No more bar plots
*   Ban the term 'statistical significance' and 'statistically
    insignificant'
