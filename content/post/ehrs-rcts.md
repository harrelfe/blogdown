It is often said that randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold
standard for learning about therapeutic effectiveness. This is because
the treatment is assigned at random so no variables, measured or
unmeasured, will be truly related to treatment assignment. The result is
an unbiased estimate of treatment effectiveness. On the other hand,
observational data arising from clinical practice has all the biases of
physicians and patients in who gets which treatment. Some treatments are
indicated for certain types of patients; some are reserved for very sick
ones. The fact is that the selection of treatment is often chosen on the
basis of patient characteristics that influence patient outcome, some of
which may be unrecorded. When the outcomes of different groups of
patients receiving different treatments are compared, without adjustment
for patient characteristics related to treatment selection and outcome,
the result is a bias called *confounding by indication*.

To set the stage for our discussion of the challenges caused by
confounding by indication, incomplete data, and unreliable data, first
consider a nearly ideal observational treatment study then consider an
ideal RCT. First, consider a potentially optimal observational cohort
design that has some possibility of providing an accurate treatment
outcome comparison. Suppose that an investigator has obtained $2M in
funding to hire trained research nurses to collect data completely and
accurately, and she has gone to the trouble of asking five expert
clinicians in the disease/treatment area to each independently list the
patient characteristics they perceive are used to select therapies for
patients. The result is a list of 18 distinct patient characteristics,
for which a data dictionary is written and case report forms are
collected. Data collectors are instructed to obtain these 18 variables
on every patient with very few exceptions, and other useful variables,
especially strong prognostic factors, are collected in addition. Details
about treatment are also captured, including the start and ending dates
of treatment, doses, and dose schedule. Outcomes are well defined and
never missing. The sample size is adequate, and when data collection is
complete, analysis of covariance is used to estimate the outcome
difference for treatment A vs. treatment B. Then the study PI discovers
that there is a strong confounder that none of the five experts thought
of, and a sensitivity analysis indicates that the original treatment
effect estimate might have been washed away by the additional confounder
had it been collected. The study results in no reliable knowledge about
the treatments.

The study just described represents a high level of observational study
quality, and still needed some luck to be useful. The treatments, entry
criteria, and follow-up clock were well defined, and there were almost
no missing data. Contrast that with the electronic health record (EHR).
If questions of therapeutic efficacy are so difficult to answer with
nearly perfect observational data how can they be reliably answered from
EHR data alone?

To complete our introduction to the discussion, envision a
well-conducted parallel-group RCT with complete follow-up and highly
accurate and relevant baseline data capture. Study inclusion criteria
allowed for a wide range of age and severity of disease. The endpoint is
time until a devastating clinical event. The treatment B:treatment A
covariate-adjusted hazard ratio is 0.8 with 0.95 credible interval of
[0.65, 0.93]. The authors, avoiding unreliable subgroup analysis,
perform a careful but comprehensive assessment of interaction between
patient types and treatment effect, finding no evidence for
heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE). The hazard ratio of 0.8 is
widely generalizable, even to populations with much different baseline
risk. A simple nomogram is drawn to show how to estimate absolute risk
reduction by treatment B at 3 years, given a patient's baseline 3y risk.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is an alarming trend in advocates of learning from the EHR saying
that statistical inference can be bypassed because (1) large numbers
overcome all obstacles, (2) the EHR reflects actual clinical practice
and patient populations, and (3) if you can predict outcomes for
individual patients you can just find out for which treatment the
predicted outcomes are optimal. Advocates of such "logic" often go on to
say that RCTs are not helpful because the proportion of patients seen in
practice that would qualify for the trial is very small with randomized
patients being unrepresentative of the clinical population, because the
trial only estimates the average treatment effect, because there must be
HTE, and because treatment conditions are unrepresentative. Without HTE,
precision medicine would have no basis. But evidence of substantial HTE
has yet to be generally established and its existence in particular
cases can be an artifact of the outcome scale used for the analysis. See
[this]({{< ref "post/rct-mimic" >}})
for more about the first two complaints about RCTs. Regarding (1),
researchers too often forget that measurement or sample bias does not
diminish no matter how large the sample size. Often, large sample sizes
only provide precise estimates of the wrong quantity.

To illustrate this problem, suppose that one is interested in estimating
and testing the treatment effect, B-A, of a certain blood pressure
lowering medication (drug B) when compared to another drug (A). Assume a
relevant subset of the EHR can be extracted in which patients started
initial monotherapy at a defined date and systolic blood pressure (SBP)
was measured routinely at useful follow-up intervals. Suppose that the
standard deviation (SD) of SBP across patients is 8 mmHg regardless of
treatment group. Suppose further that minor confounding by indication is
present due to the failure to adjust for an unstated patient feature
involved in the drug choice, which creates a systematic unidirectional
bias of 2 mmHg in estimating the true B-A difference in mean SBP. If the
EHR has m patients in each treatment group, the variance of the
estimated mean difference is the sum of the variances of the two
individual means or 64/m + 64/m = 128/m. But the variance only tells us
about how close our sample estimate is to the incorrect value, B-A + 2
mmHg. It is the mean squared error, the variance plus the square of the
bias or 128/m + 4, that relates to the probability that the estimate is
close to the true treatment effect B-A. As m gets larger, the variance
goes to zero indicating a stable estimate has been achieved. But the
bias is constant so the mean squared error remains at 4 (root mean
squared error = 2 mmHg).

Now consider an RCT that is designed not to estimate the mean SBP for A
or the mean SBP for B but, as with all randomized trials, is designed to
estimate the B-A difference (treatment effect). If the trial randomized
m subjects per treatment group, the variance of the mean difference is
128/m and the mean squared error is also 128/m. The comparison of the
square root of mean squared errors for an EHR study and an equal-sized
RCT is depicted in the figure below. Here, we have even given the EHR
study the benefit of the doubt in assuming that SBP is measured as
accurately as would be the case in the RCT. This is unlikely, and so in
reality the results presented below are optimistic for the performance
of the EHR.

EHR studies have the potential to provide far larger sample sizes than
RCTs, but note that an RCT with a total sample size of 64 subjects is as
informative as an EHR study with infinitely many patients. **Bigger is
not better**. What if the SBP measurements from the EHR, not collected
under any protocol, are less accurate than those collected under the RCT
protocol? Let’s exemplify that by setting the SD for SBP to 10 mmHg for
the EHR while leaving it as 8 mmHg for the RCT. For very large sample
sizes, bias trumps variance so the breakeven point of 64 subjects
remains, but for non-large EHRs the increased variability of measured
SBPs harms the margin of error of EHR estimate of mean SBP difference.

We have addressed estimation error for the treatment effect, but note
that while an EHR-based statistical test for any treatment difference
will have excellent power for large n, this comes at the expense of
being far from preserving the type I error, which is essentially 1.0 due
to the estimation bias causing the two-sample statistical test to be
biased.

Interestingly, bias decreases the benefits achieved by larger sample
sizes to the extent that, in contrast to an unbiased RCT, the mean
squared error for an EHR of size 3000 in our example is nearly identical
to what it would be with an infinite sample size. While this disregards
the need for larger samples to target multiple treatments or distinct
patient populations, it does suggest that overcoming the specific
resource-intensive challenges associated with handling huge EHR samples
may yield fewer advances in medical treatment than anticipated by some,
if the effects of bias are considered.

There is a mantra heard in data science that you just need to "let the
data speak." You can indeed learn much from observational data if
quality and completeness of data are high (this is for another
discussion; EHRs have major weakness just in these two aspects). But
data frequently teach us things that are [just plain
wrong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGGGDpb04Yc). This is due to a
variety of reasons, including seeing trends and patterns that can be
easily explained by pure noise. Moreover, treatment group comparisons in
EHRs can reflect both the effects of treatment and the effects of
specific prior patient conditions that led to the choice of treatment in
the first place - conditions that may not be captured in the EHR. The
latter problem is confounding by indication, and this can only be
overcome by randomization, strong assumptions, or having high-quality
data on all the potential confounders (patient baseline characteristics
related to treatment selection and to outcome--rarely if ever possible).
Many clinical researchers relying on EHRs do not take the time to even
list the relevant patient characteristics before rationalizing that the
EHR is adequate. To make matters worse, EHRs frequently do not provide
accurate data on when patients started and stopped treatment.
Furthermore, the availability of patient outcomes can depend on the very
course of treatment and treatment response under study. For example,
when a trial protocol is not in place, lab tests are not ordered at
pre-specified times but because of a changing patient condition. If EHR
cannot provide a reliable estimate of the average treatment effect how
could it provide reliable estimates of differential treatment benefit
(HTE)?

Regarding the problem with signal vs. noise in "let the data speak", we
envision a clinician watching someone playing a slot machine in Las
Vegas. The clinician observes that a small jackpot was hit after 17
pulls of the lever, and now has a model for success: go to a random slot
machine with enough money to make 17 pulls. Here the problem is not a
biased sample but pure noise.

Observational data, when complete and accurate, can form the basis for
accurate predictions. But what are predictions really good for?
Generally speaking, predictions can be used to estimate likely patient
outcomes given prevailing clinical practice and treatment choices, with
typical adherence to treatment. Prediction is good for natural history
studies and for counseling patients about their likely outcomes. What is
needed for selecting optimum treatments is an answer to the "what if"
question: what is the likely outcome of this patient were she given
treatment A vs. were she given treatment B? This is inherently a problem
of causal inference, which is why such questions are best answered using
experimental designs, such as RCTs. When there is evidence that the
complete, accurate observational data captured and eliminated
confounding by indication, then and only then can observational data be
a substitute for RCTs in making smart treatment choices.

What is a good global strategy for making optimum decisions for
individual patients? Much more could be said, but for starters consider
the following steps:

-   Obtain the best covariate-adjusted estimate of relative treatment
    effect (e.g., odds ratio, hazards ratio) from an RCT. Check whether
    this estimate is constant or whether it depends on patient
    characteristics (i.e., whether heterogeneity of treatment effect
    exists on the relative scale). One possible strategy, using fully
    specified interaction tests adjusted for all main effects, is in
    *[Biostatistics for Biomedical Research](http://fharrell.com/links)*
		in the  Analysis of Covariance chapter.
-   Develop a predictive model from complete, accurate observational
    data, and perform strong interval validation using the bootstrap to
    verify absolute calibration accuracy. Use this model to handle risk
    magnification whereby absolute treatment benefits are greater for
    sicker patients in most cases.
-   Apply the relative treatment effects from the RCT, separately for
    treatment A and treatment B, to the estimated outcome risk from the
    observational data to obtain estimates of absolute treatment benefit
    (B vs. A) for the patient. See the first figure below which relates
    a hazard ratio to absolute improvement in survival probability.
-   Develop a nomogram using the RCT data to estimate absolute treatment
    benefit for an individual patient. See the second figure below whose
    bottom axis is the difference between two logistic regression
    models. (Both figures are from
    [BBR](http://fharrell.com/links) Chapter 13)
