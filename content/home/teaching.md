## Biostatistics in Biomedical Research
![](/img/headers/bbrlogo.png)

A free web course in introductory and intermediate biostatistics
starts on September 27, 2019.  This course is offered about three Fridays
per month probably from 10am-11am US Eastern Time.  The course is live streamed
on YouTube, and recorded for watching offline on YouTube channel
[BBRcourse](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-o_ZZ0tuFUYn8e8rf-QURA).
The course is intended for biomedical researchers, and 
statisticians may also enjoy the course and entering into the live
discussion on YouTube.  The course is sponsored by the [Vanderbilt
Institute for Clinical and Translational
Research](https://victr.vumc.org) (VICTR) **Research Methods Program**
in the Department of Biostatistics  of the School of Medicine, and is done
in coordination with [Edge for Scholars](https://edgeforscholars.org).
VICTR is funded by the [National Center for Advancing Translational
Sciences](https://ncats.nih.gov) of NIH.  More
details and a place to suggest future topics may be found
[here](https://discourse.datamethods.org/t/bbr-video-course).  The
main course notes are [BBR](http://hbiostat.org/doc/bbr.pdf).

Participants are required to register for the course and in so doing
must provide basic information that allows us to report aggregate
participant characteristics to our funding agencies.  A valid email
address is required for registration.  To register for the course, go
[here]() once you see the announcement on Twitter `@f2harrell` that
registration is open. 

## Regression Modeling Strategies
I teach the BIOS7330 _Regression Modeling Strategies_ course in the
Biostatistics Graduate Program at Vanderbilt University in the spring
semester.  The course web page is
[here](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/CourseBios330).  I teach a
4-day version of this course each May at Vanderbilt.  Registration
information for the short course may be found
[here](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/RmS).

## Master of Science in Clinical Investigation Biostatistics II
I co-teach [this
course](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/MsciBiostatII) at
Vanderbilt each February for postdoctoral medical and surgical fellows
and junior faculty in the MSCI program.
